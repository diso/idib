_Building the Firefox Plugin from SV_

= Introduction =

There is a build script provided that makes building from source simple and easy.

== Prerequisites ==

Subversion (SVN) installed so you can check out the project tree.
Python 2.3 or greater. The build script requires you to have python installed.

= How To =

  # Check the code out via SVN
{{{
svn checkout http://browser-identity.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ browser-identity
}}}
  # Inside the browser-identity directory you checked out, run package.py and specify whether or not you want to build the debug or stable version.
{{{
python package.py debug
}}}
The package script should do the rest. There will be a 'export/' directory created in the project directory that will contain some build files along with the .xpi plugin file for testing.
